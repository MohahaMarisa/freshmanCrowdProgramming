		<p>How many individuals are in the picture? Sometimes, the person is only partially shown, so computers don't count </p>
		<p>them as in the picture even though a regular person might recognize that there are more people than faces in the photo</p>
		<p>Help us count how many people are probably in the picture. For large crowd pictures, just give it your best estimate!</p>
